# Week-One-Challenge

## Description

For the Week One Challenge, I was tasked with fixing and cleaning the index.html code and corresponding css style sheet for the Horiseon webpage. The requirements of the finished website were that the links in the header functioned correctly, the css selectors and properties were consolidated and organised, and comments were added to the css code.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The webpage's headers on the top right now move the screen to the corresponding main section of the webpage when clicked, which gives more detail about each heading. The webpage gives the user a general overview of the digital social services the company "horiseon" provide.

## Links
